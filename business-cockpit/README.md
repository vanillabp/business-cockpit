# The library

The Business Cockpit as a library: the services and the persistence behind the two lists, the GUI
API, the security extension points, the part which takes in what workflow modules report, the
notification feature, the proxy to workflow modules, and the React application under
`src/main/webapp`.

It has no main class and builds no runnable jar. What makes it start is [container](../container),
and that split is explained in [its README](../container/README.md#why-the-library-and-the-application-are-two-modules).
A custom cockpit depends on this module, which the wiki describes under
[Building a custom Business Cockpit](https://github.com/vanillabp/business-cockpit/wiki/Building-a-custom-Business-Cockpit).

Anything a custom cockpit would also need belongs here rather than in `container`. Built as part of
the reactor build described in the [root README](../README.md#building-it), and published as
`io.vanillabp.businesscockpit:business-cockpit`.
