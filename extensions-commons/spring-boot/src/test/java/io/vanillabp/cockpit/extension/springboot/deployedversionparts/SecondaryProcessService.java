 * The provider of the workflow serves version 2. The called process never gets a workflow report
 * of its own, so that provider is not checked against version 1. The provider of the user task of
 * the called process serves version 1 only. It belongs to the model of the called process, so it
 * is checked against version 1, and the boot runs.
